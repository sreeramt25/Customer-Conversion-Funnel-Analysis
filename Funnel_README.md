# Swiggy Funnel Analysis

## Project Overview

Swiggy, one of the largest food eCommerce platforms in the country, processes over 1 million transactions daily. In this project, I analyzed Swiggy's performance data for the year 2019 to generate insights into the company's operations. The analysis was conducted using the 'Funnel Case Study Data' workbook, which includes three key worksheets:

- **Session Details**: Contains date-wise session counts for various stages including listing, menu, cart, payment, and order sessions.
- **Channel-wise Traffic**: Provides a breakdown of traffic (listing sessions) at the date level.

## Objectives

1. **Identify Key Metrics**: 
   - Analyze session counts to determine highs and lows in orders compared to the same day last week.
   - Identify changes in traffic and conversion rates using defined metrics.
   
2. **Insights Generation**:
   - Pinpoint dates with significant fluctuations in order volume.
   - Examine changes in traffic and conversion rates to find patterns or anomalies.
   - Investigate conversion metrics: L2M (Listing to Menu), M2C (Menu to Cart), C2P (Cart to Payment), and P2O (Payment to Order).

3. **Hypothesis Creation**:
   - Develop hypotheses regarding fluctuations in conversions.
   - Validate hypotheses using supporting data.

## Findings

- **Order Fluctuations**: Detailed analysis of dates with significant increases or decreases in orders.
- **Traffic Changes**: Insights into whether traffic fluctuated and its source.
- **Conversion Rate Analysis**: Breakdown of conversion metrics to identify fluctuations and underlying causes.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Imported and cleaned the provided Excel data.
   - Added columns for new metrics based on the defined conversion stages.

2. **Analysis**:
   - Compared daily session counts with the same day of the previous week to detect highs and lows.
   - Evaluated traffic changes and their potential impact on overall conversions.
   - Analyzed smaller conversion metrics to identify sources of fluctuations.

3. **Reporting**:
   - Compiled a comprehensive report in a Word document detailing the findings, insights, and explanations for observed fluctuations.
   - Provided a structured and formatted document for clear communication of results.

## Report

The detailed report is available in this repository . It includes a list of dates with significant changes, reasons for these changes, and supporting data for hypotheses validation.

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel
